# Course Syllabus
## Intended learning outcomes


- analyze multivariate data by using appropriate multivariate models,
- account for mathematical models related to various multivariate methods and derive theoretical results from these models,
- apply hypothesis testing and large sample theory to assess the credibility of the results obtained by multivariate models,
- use computer simulations to solve multivariate statistical problems,
- account for different types of covariance structures and their impact on interpretation,
- apply multivariate methods for dimension reduction.


## Course content

The course comprises the mathematical theory for the multivariate normal distribution and its related distributions, as well as the practical application of this theory to a range of multivariate statistical model and inference problems in statistics, machine learning and engineering.

The course includes:

- matrix algebra, random vectors and matrices
- multivariate normal distribution, mathematical properties of sampling distributions and large sample theory.
- inference of mean vectors, related hypothesis testing models and confidence regions
- principal component analysis and large sample inference
- factor analysis,
- canonical correlation analysis and large sample inference,
- MANOVA models.
